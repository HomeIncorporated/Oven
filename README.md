# Oven

Generates C# MVC Backend, React (React-Admin) Frontend

Oven.Console uses hard coded configuration to generate a configuration UI that can then be used to call the Oven.Api Project to Generate your own application

## History
The project has been rewritten many times going through the commit history it generates in different ways.

The current commit generates a Mongo DB Data Access Layer, [React-Admin](https://github.com/marmelab/react-admin) UI

Previously it generated a EF Core SQL Server Data Access Layer.

Way back I was generating an angular 2+ UI
